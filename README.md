# MyReads Project

This is the project made for the Udacity React Nanodegree. In this project, we are taking the advantages of React Native to build a mobile flashcard application. 

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the simulators with `yarn ios` or `yarn android`
